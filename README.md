# Weather Visualizer

## Description

This application will be a command line app that makes an API call to give the user the weather in their area. Additionally, it will provide a visualization of the weather. App will use the OpenWeatherMap API to find the weather for the user's area, and will use Nannou to create a visualization of the weather. Specific cities will have special visualization, such as of important landmarks. The visualization will match up with the weather report, so a forecast of sunny skies will result in an image with a sunny sky.
